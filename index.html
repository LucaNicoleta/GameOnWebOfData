      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This technical report contains details about the internal data structures and the APIs to be 
        used in the "Game On Web Of Data" <b>#GaDa</b> project.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Our project is going to be a simple web role playing game <b>(RPG)</b> having its characters described in 
        <b>RDF</b> based on <b>knowledge models</b>. Also, interrogations will be performed by 
        using <b>SPARQL</b> query language.
      </br> </br>

      The objective of this report is to explain what is the game logic, how it can be played, what characters and what data is taken
      into considerations from external APIs in order to create them. We will describe the components we will 
      develope and integrate in our project.

      <p>
        Rules, limitations, player interactions, characteristics, and assets will be modeled and 
        accessed by using <b>RDF</b>, <b>SPARQL</b>, <b>RDF Schema</b>, <b>SKOS</b>, and <b>OWL</b>. 
      </p>
        
        <p>
          We will use Java & Spring Framework for backend, React & Typescript for frontend, and MongoDB for database. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>More info will be written as the application is developed.</b>
        </p>

      <h2>Game Overview</h2>

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>The story will be influenced by the player' Pokémon, decisions, experience, and level.</p>

      <h3>Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        The player can move his game character in different directions to different locations, can find hidden objects, 
        can meet rivals NPC characters. Also, he can find and catch Pokémon.
      </p>

      <h3>Items</h3>
      <p>
        The player can find hidden objects while playing which can be used in order to get different benefits, gain or lose points.
      </p>

      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the game, the player can select from a list which Marvel character he wants to represent. </br>
        Also, in the game will be NPC Marvel characters. </br>
        Each character will have a set of pokémon with different powers and abilities. These pokémon will be used in 
        battles with other Marvel characters' pokémon. 
      </p>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is to earn enough points (or experience) to reach the next level. The player can earn points 
        by accepting and winning pokémon battles with the NPC Marvel characters he can meet while exploring 
        or by finding and collecting (and/or using) hidden items.
      </p>

      <h3>Levels</h3>
      <p>
        A certain level can give the player's Pokémon more skills, powers, and make them stronger, increasing their chances to win a battle.
        More than that, different Pokémon, items, and NPC Marvel characters can show up after a specific level.
      </p>

      <h3>Action</h3>
      <p>
        As the player explores various locations, he may encounter NPC rivals with whom he can start a battle.
      </p>

      <h3>Interface</h3>
      <p>
        All interactions between players and the game itself is textual.
        The player can choose from a set of options the next move he wants to make by clicking on it
        (the available actions/moves are based on a specific context). </br> </br>

        The evolution of the story will be presented through a text. </br>
        When needed, a help info can be shown at the interface (tutorial).
      </p>

      <h2>Software Components</h2>

      <section id="component-1">
        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>
          The <b>DB</b> we are going to use is <b>MongoDB</b>.</br> We will save the relevent data such as
          users and their game progress, or game settings.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="component-2">
        <h3>RestAPI</h3>
        <p>
          The API provided by the server side is able to send data to the client.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="component-3">
        <h3>Battle Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          This component generates rules and strategies for both player and NPC players. 
        </p>
      </section>

      
      <section id="component-4">
        <h3>Game State</h3>
        <p>
          The game state component contains the progress of the player, his points, his level. 
           </br> </br>

          Based on the game state different actions can be generated. For example, based on a certain state:
          <ul>
            <li>it can be decided if the player can move to the next level</li>
            <li>it can be decided if a specific help message can be shown to the user</li>
            <li>it can be decided what is the next scene</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="component-5">
        <h3>Authentification</h3>
        <p>
          This component is responsible for user registration and authentication.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="component-5">
        <h3>Game Settings</h3>
        <p>
          This component will allow the user to change and save different game settings such as sound on/off, 
          nickname change, text colors.

      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="External APIs">
      <h3>External APIs</h3>
      The project will use two external APIs: Marvel Comics API and PokeAPI.

      <section id="api-1">
        <h3>Marvel Comics API</h3>
        <p>
          We will use the <a href="https://developer.marvel.com/">Marvel Comics</a> API's base endpoint <b>http(s)://gateway.marvel.com/</b> to get
          different resources in order to build our game characters. The resources provided by this API are
          represented as <b>JSON objects</b> and we will be able to access them through an <b>API key</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the available resources provided by the Marvel Comics API, we will use in our
          project the data about <b>Marvel Characters</b>: the women, men, organizations, alien species, deities,
          animals, non-corporeal entities, trans-dimensional manifestations, abstract personifications, and green
          amorphous blobs which occupy the Marvel Universe (and various alternate universes, timelines and
          altered realities therein). For example, Spider-Man. We will also use the <b>image</b> of each marvel character.
        </p>
      </section>
       

      <section id="api-2">
        <h3>PokéAPI</h3>
        <p>
          The second API we are going to use is <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokéAPI</a>. Its base endpoint is <b>https://pokeapi.co/api/</b>. 
          This API has two versions v1, and v2. We will use the second version of it, v2. The endpoint we will use is
          <b>https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/{endpoint}</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The resources provided by this API are represented as <b>JSON objects</b> and we are able to access
          them <b>without an API key</b>. This API can provide us useful resources in order to create pokémon with
          different powers, abilities, levels, and more.
        </p>
